# BooksList

This is a flask-based web service that allows users to create a wishlist of the books they want to read, add books so they can be wishlisted, and rate / review books. This particular version uses a Monolithic architecture.

# Building and running

To run and test our code, ensure flask is installed via `pip install flask`, then run `python main.py`
